<!-- Section 1.1: Achievement of Research Objectives (MANDATORY) -->
<div class="section-header">
<h2><span class="badge">MANDATORY</span> 1.1 Achievement of Research Objectives</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-content">

<p>The project has successfully achieved its core research objectives, delivering methodological innovations, empirical validations, and practical tools for credit risk assessment in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending markets.</p>

<div class="objective-box">
<span class="achievement-tag">ACHIEVED</span>
<h4>Objective 1: Develop Advanced, Interpretable Credit Risk Models for P2P Lending</h4>
<p>We developed a novel two-step machine learning approach that combines network centrality metrics with traditional credit risk factors. This methodology constructs borrower similarity graphs using origination-time information and extracts multiple centrality measures (PageRank, betweenness, closeness, Katz, hub/authority) as predictive features. The approach was validated using Elastic Net, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and XGBoost models, demonstrating significant improvements in default prediction accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Liu et al. (2024), "Leveraging network topology for credit risk assessment in P2P lending: A comparative study under the lens of machine learning," <em>Expert Systems with Applications</em>, Vol. 252, Article 124100. <strong>17 citations, 214 downloads.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="objective-box">
<span class="achievement-tag">ACHIEVED</span>
<h4>Objective 2: Test and Compare Network-Enhanced Models with Real P2P Datasets</h4>
<p>We conducted comprehensive empirical validation using the Bondora P2P lending dataset, comprising 231,039 individual borrowers characterized through 112 categorical and continuous variables. The analysis demonstrated that a borrower's network position and connectivity within the P2P network significantly influences loan default probabilities. Robustness checks using shuffled centrality features confirmed the predictive value of network topology features.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Liu et al. (2024), "Network centrality and credit risk: A comprehensive analysis of peer-to-peer lending dynamics," <em>Finance Research Letters</em>, Vol. 63, Article 105308. <strong>11 citations.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="objective-box">
<span class="achievement-tag">ACHIEVED</span>
<h4>Objective 3: Address Information Asymmetry through Network Analysis</h4>
<p>We developed network-based methods to identify potentially mispriced loans by combining interest-rate information with borrower risk characteristics. Community detection algorithms (Louvain) enable segment-level structure analysis, while cluster-based diagnostics identify pricing anomalies. This addresses the higher information asymmetry in P2P platforms compared to traditional banking.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Working papers on credit-risk pricing (Zenodo deposits 17990873, 17990398) and systematic literature review covering 78 articles on graph-based credit models.</p>
</div>

<div class="objective-box">
<span class="achievement-tag">ACHIEVED</span>
<h4>Objective 4: Implement Explainable AI for Model Interpretability</h4>
<p>All models were complemented with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) analyses. We developed surrogate decision trees and manual tree-based interpretation frameworks for regime detection models. Complete reproducibility is ensured through 12 Zenodo deposits containing Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong> SHAP explainability notebooks in Zenodo deposit 17991107; tree-based interpretation framework in Zenodo deposit 17990398.</p>
</div>

<div class="objective-box">
<span class="achievement-tag">ACHIEVED</span>
<h4>Objective 5: Build Research Capacity and International Collaboration</h4>
<p>The project trained two PhD researchers (Lennart John Baals and Yiting Liu) who developed expertise in digital finance, network modeling, and explainable AI. We established collaborations with five international institutions across four continents (Masaryk University, Columbia University, American University of Sharjah, Renmin University of China, University of Manchester). The PI serves as Action Chair of COST Action CA19130 (Fintech and AI in Finance) and Coordinator of the MSCA Industrial Doctoral Network on Digital Finance.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Additional Funding Secured:</strong> The project's success attracted CHF 90,000 in additional funding: two SNSF Mobility Grants (CHF 20,000 each) and a Leading House Asia grant (CHF 50,000) for related digital assets research, bringing total project funding to CHF 297,028.</p>

<!-- Section 1.2: Challenges, Negative Results and Unexpected Outcomes -->
<div class="section-header">
<h2><span class="badge">OPTIONAL</span> 1.2 Challenges, Negative Results and Unexpected Outcomes</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-content">

<p><strong>Data Access Challenges:</strong> Access to proprietary P2P lending data proved more restrictive than anticipated. While we successfully utilized the Bondora public dataset, platform terms (section 13.4) prevented redistribution of raw data. This led us to focus on reproducible code and documentation in our Zenodo deposits, with clear instructions for researchers to obtain data under their own access rights.</p>

<p><strong>Platform Evolution:</strong> The P2P lending landscape evolved significantly during the project period, with some platforms reducing operations or changing data policies. This required flexibility in our empirical strategy, ultimately strengthening our focus on methodological contributions that can be applied across different platforms and datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Computational Scaling:</strong> Network construction for large loan portfolios presented computational challenges. We addressed this through efficient similarity thresholding and k-nearest-neighbor connection rules to maintain connectivity while managing graph size. The force simulation parameters in our D3 visualizations were optimized for performance on various devices.</p>

<p><strong>Unexpected Finding:</strong> Our analysis revealed that network position (degree centrality) alone provides substantial predictive power, sometimes matching or exceeding more complex centrality measures. This simplified insight has practical implications for platform operators seeking interpretable risk indicators.</p>

</div>

<!-- Section 1.3: Contribution to Knowledge Advancement -->
<div class="section-header">
<h2><span class="badge">OPTIONAL</span> 1.3 Contribution to Knowledge Advancement</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-content">

<p><strong>Methodological Contribution:</strong> We established network topology as a viable and valuable feature source for credit risk modeling in P2P lending. Our two-step ML approach provides a replicable framework for combining structural and attribute-based predictors. The systematic literature review (78 articles analyzed) provides a comprehensive synthesis of graph-based credit modeling approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Practical Impact:</strong> Our models and code are directly applicable to P2P lending platforms for risk assessment. The interpretability framework using SHAP/LIME enables platform operators to explain credit decisions to borrowers and regulators, addressing transparency requirements in automated lending decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Open Science Contribution:</strong> All 12 Zenodo deposits (100% open access) ensure complete reproducibility of our findings. The deposits include LaTeX sources, Jupyter notebooks, Python/R scripts, and comprehensive documentation, enabling other researchers to validate, extend, and build upon our work.</p>

<p><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Two PhD researchers were trained in cutting-edge methods at the intersection of network science, machine learning, and finance. Knowledge transfer activities included an Expert Day workshop at FINMA (Swiss financial regulator) and presentations at international research events in eight countries.</p>

<p><strong>Research Network Leadership:</strong> The PI's roles as COST Action Chair and MSCA Network Coordinator enabled broad dissemination of project findings across 40+ European institutions, creating lasting infrastructure for fintech research collaboration.</p>
