In typical use-cases of Self-Play, two AI agents play against each other in a particular game, e.g., chess or Go. By repeatedly playing the game, they learn its rules as well as possible winning strategies. When considering financial markets, however, we usually have one player—the trader—that does not face one individual adversary but competes against a vast u..."

The established literature fails to match the increasing number of explainable AI (XAI) methods with the different stakeholders’ explainability need..."

The extension is based on network models, which improve pure autoregressive models, introducing a contemporaneous contagion component that describes contagion effect..."
