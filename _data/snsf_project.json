  "research": {
    "background": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has become an increasingly popular alternative to traditional bank lending, allowing individuals and businesses to borrow money directly from investors through online platforms without involving banks. While this method offers advantages such as higher returns for investors and greater access to credit for borrowers, it also brings unique risks. The decentralized nature of P2P lending means that loans are funded entirely by investors, without the safeguards of bank intermediation.",
    "rationale": "The growing presence of P2P lending markets, especially during economic crises, exposes these platforms to significant risks, including adverse selection and moral hazard. Unlike traditional banks that use long-term relationships and extensive data to evaluate borrowers, P2P platforms have less detailed information and face higher levels of uncertainty. There is a critical need for robust credit risk models that can accurately assess the creditworthiness of borrowers in these markets.",
    "objectives": [
      "Develop advanced, interpretable credit risk models tailored to P2P lending markets",
      "Address higher information asymmetry in P2P platforms",
      "Improve risk assessment during economic downturns",
