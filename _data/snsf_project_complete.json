    "scientific_abstract": "The proposed research project focuses on the development of new credit risk models for P2P credit markets enhanced by features from networks. We will test and compare the usefulness of new models with several real data sets from P2P credit markets worldwide. For a credit risk model to be useful, we also need to consider the interpretability of our models. The research project has both methodological and empirical features with practical implications.",
    "background": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has become an increasingly popular alternative to traditional bank lending, allowing individuals and businesses to borrow money directly from investors through online platforms without involving banks. While this method offers advantages such as higher returns for investors and greater access to credit for borrowers, it also brings unique risks. The decentralized nature of P2P lending means that loans are funded entirely by investors, without the safeguards of bank intermediation. In times of economic downturn, the risk is heightened as more borrowers who may not qualify for traditional bank loans turn to P2P platforms.",
    "rationale": "The growing presence of P2P lending markets, especially during economic crises, exposes these platforms to significant risks, including adverse selection and moral hazard. Unlike traditional banks that use long-term relationships and extensive data to evaluate borrowers, P2P platforms have less detailed information and face higher levels of uncertainty. Traditional banks possess richer data through long-term relationships, whereas P2P platforms must develop alternative mechanisms to establish investor trust.",
    "objectives": [
      "Develop advanced, interpretable credit risk models tailored to P2P lending markets",
      "Test and compare usefulness of network-enhanced models with real P2P datasets",
      "Address higher information asymmetry in P2P platforms",
      "Incorporate inter-entity relationships to assess risk transmission",
      "Create state-of-the-art models for P2P platforms characterized by loose regulation",
      "Enhance trust between investors and P2P platforms"
    ],
    "methods": [
      "Network-based approaches analyzing connections between borrowers and lenders",
      "Graph theory and network topology analysis",
      "Machine learning models (Elastic Net, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost)",
      "Network centrality metrics (degree centrality)",
      "Two-step ML approach combining network features with traditional credit factors",
      "Explainable AI techniques (LIME, SHAP)"
    ],
    "expected_impact": "The research will produce new, cutting-edge credit risk models that can be applied directly to P2P lending platforms. These models will improve the ability of investors to assess borrower risk, leading to more accurate loan pricing, reduced default rates, and greater confidence in the P2P lending ecosystem."

Despite their increasing popularity, P2P lending poses significant challenges related to credit risk assessment and default prediction with meaningful implications for financial stability. Traditional credit risk models have been widely employed in the field of P2P lending; however, they may not be capable to capture latent factor information inherent to a loan network. This paper develops a two-step ML approach combining network centrality metrics with traditional credit risk factors to enhance default prediction.",
