    "description": "OverviewThis deposit provides the materials required to reproduce the empirical workflow and figures of the study: “State-Dependent Pricing in FinTech Credit: Evidence from P2P Lending.” The study is part of the doctoral dissertation “Risk Management in Digital Finance: Assessment and Pricing in an Emerging Fintech Era” (Chapter 5) by Lennart John Baals. The repository contains (i) the LaTeX source of the manuscript / chapter, (ii) the Python implementation of the macro-factor extraction and regime detection pipeline (robust rolling PCA + Gaussian HMM), (iii) explainability utilities (surrogate/manual decision trees), and (iv) the resulting figures used in the accompanying PDF.

A public data set can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/danofer/lendingclub-data-defaults/input)). To support responsible reuse, this deposit focuses on code, documentation, and figure outputs. If any raw loan-level dataset cannot be redistributed, users should obtain it directly from the original provider under their own access rights and then map it to the variable names expected by the notebook/scripts (the notebook documents the required columns and preprocessing steps). Any included data descriptions are intended to make this mapping transparent and reproducible. Reproducibility (how to run)A typical reproduction path is: Create a Python environment (tested in a standard scientific Python stack). Open and run Auto_R_I_XAI_R2_RD_Tree_v010.ipynb, which orchestrates preprocessing, factor extraction, regime inference, and plot generation. Alternatively, import the modular pipeline components (robust PCA, HMM, explainability utilities) from the included .py files. To maximize portability, the code is organized as small, readable modules corresponding to each methodological step (factor extraction → regime detection → explainability → plotting). Intended useThis deposit is intended for: replication of the reported figures and regime classification logic, inspection and reuse of the robust PCA + HMM regime detection pipeline, and extension to other loan datasets or macro indicator panels under comparable conditions.",

In brief, the analysis: constructs borrower/loan similarity relationships from origination-time covariates (excluding ex post information), generates network representations and identifies community structure (cluster-specific segmentation), compares observed pricing and realized credit outcomes across communities and time periods (including “before/after” comparisons), and derives mispricing indicators at the loan level and aggregated at the community and rating level, supported by diagnostic plots. The included figures document both the segmentation structure (community network layouts) and the empirical implications for pricing (interest rates), risk outcomes (default rates), and mispricing patterns. Data sources and access conditionsThe empirical component uses Bondora P2P lending data (loan-level information). Redistribution may be restricted by data-provider terms and privacy constraints. This deposit therefore focuses on manuscript source, code/notebooks, and figure outputs. Users intending to fully reproduce the analysis should obtain the underlying raw data directly from the original source under their own access rights and then apply the provided preprocessing and variable mapping steps as documented in the notebooks/scripts. Any included data descriptions are intended to facilitate transparent replication while respecting the applicable redistribution constraints. Reproducibility (how to run)A typical reproduction path is: Open the Quarto files (.qmd) to follow the analysis narrative and regenerate plots where data access permits. Execute the R script (Bondora-1.R) for the core preprocessing and network construction steps (subject to local data availability). Rebuild the manuscript PDF from the LaTeX source (main_WP4_PhD_Lennart_Baals.tex) after regenerating figures or using the figure outputs provided in this deposit.

    "description": "OverviewThis deposit archives the conference presentation materials for a talk delivered at the 4th International Symposium on Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (Hong Kong) on 17 December 2024. The presentation reports a systematic literature review (SLR) on graph-based models for credit risk assessment, with emphasis on applications in banking networks and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. The talk synthesizes how network/graph methodologies (e.g., centrality-based scoring, community/latent factor models, Graph Neural Networks) complement traditional credit-risk approaches by capturing interdependencies, contagion mechanisms, and dynamic relational information that borrower-level feature models may miss.

Systematic review design: literature search in Scopus and Web of Science using graph/network and credit-risk related keywords; structured screening and quality checks; final sample of 78 articles from 1,066 retrieved records. Coding framework: consistent extraction of graph type, task type, application setting (e.g., credit scoring vs. systemic risk), data source, model methodology, metrics, and validation design (including a double-blind coding step). Synthesis of findings: rapid growth of the literature since ~2018; interdisciplinary publication outlets; recurring applications across P2P lending/SME scoring and systemic risk in interbank networks; emerging techniques including GNNs and hypergraph formulations. Challenges and future directions: data access/quality, scalability for large dynamic graphs, and practical integration of graph-based methods with traditional statistical credit-risk models; outlook toward real-time scoring and other network-based credit applications.

Network construction: build a borrower/loan similarity graph using origination-time information and derive network representations suitable for extracting structural signals. Topology features: compute multiple centrality measures (e.g., PageRank, betweenness, closeness, Katz, hub/authority) as additional predictors to augment standard credit features. Benchmarking under machine learning: compare predictive performance across a set of baseline and non-linear models (e.g., linear baselines and tree-/DL-based learners) and report results using ROC/AUC-style metrics.

    "title": "Identifying Mispriced Loans through Interest Rate-Based Network Analysis and Clustering in P2P Lending Markets",
    "description": "OverviewThis deposit archives the presentation materials for a talk delivered at a doctoral seminar at the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH) on 29 November 2023. The presentation documents early foundational work that later developed into my doctoral research on network-based identification of interest-rate mispricing in P2P lending, forming the basis for the subsequent thesis chapter on credit-risk pricing and mispricing in primary-market P2P loans. The talk introduces a practical methodology to detect potentially mispriced loans by combining interest-rate information with borrower risk characteristics in a similarity-based network, followed by community detection and cluster-based diagnostics. Contents of this deposit (file-level summary) Seminar presentation (PDF): Doktorandenseminar_BFH_2024_Lennart_Baals.pdf LaTeX source (slides): Doktorandenseminar_Lennart_Baals.tex Figures / assets: Graphics.zip (contains all images referenced by the LaTeX source) What the presentation covers (research scope and key elements) Motivation and problem statement: P2P platforms assign interest rates to reflect borrower risk, but mispricing can occur when rates deviate from what comparable loans would imply, potentially leading to unfair pricing and elevated default risk. Data preparation (illustrative sample): construction of a cleaned loan sample including borrower characteristics and loan terms, with preprocessing steps such as outlier handling, encoding of categorical features, and removal of highly correlated variables. Network construction: creation of a weighted, undirected loan similarity graph using a composite similarity score that blends (i) interest-rate similarity and (ii) risk-factor similarity (mixed-type similarity via Gower distance). A thresholding step retains strong similarities, complemented by a k-nearest-neighbour connection rule to avoid isolated nodes and ensure connectivity. Network analysis: computation of standard network measures (e.g., degree and betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient) and community detection (Louvain) to obtain segment-level structure. Clustering layer: complementary clustering via Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) using pricing and network-derived features, with BIC-based selection of the number of clusters and cluster-level summaries (interest rate vs default rate, distributions, and statistical comparisons). Mispricing definitions: Ex-post mispricing flags (illustrative): high-rate non-defaults (overpriced) and low-rate defaults (underpriced) using distributional thresholds (e.g., quartiles). Ex-ante mispricing workflow (concept): predict an expected risk category (e.g., a platform rating) using only ex-ante variables (including network metrics), map predicted categories to expected rate intervals, and classify loans as mispriced if the deviation between actual and expected rates exceeds a specified threshold. Limitations and outlook: notes on platform/time dependence, modelling assumptions, and extensions toward larger samples and more advanced models.

Through combining traditional credit features with network topological features, namely the degree centrality, we showcase the crucial role of a borrower’s position and connectivity within the P2P network in determining loan default probabilities. Our findings are bolstered by robustness checks using shuffled centrality features, which further underscore the significance of integrating both financial and network attributes in credit risk evaluation. Our results shed new light on credit risk determinants in P2P lending and benefit investors in capturing inherent information from P2P loan networks.Keywords: Peer-to-Peer lending; Credit-default prediction; Machine Learning; Network centrality Raw data: The raw dataset was downloaded on April 22nd, 2022, as a part of Bandora’s daily updated public report.3 Loan starting dates span from June 16th, 2009, to April 21st, 2022. The original dataset covers 231,039 individual borrowers characterized through 112 categorical and continuous variables. Among these loans, 79,424 have been recorded with delayed interest payments according to the platform, while 151,615 loans have no recorded delay on interest payments before the download date of the data.

For consistency and comparability, we use the same four benchmark datasets as in \\citet{shi_improved_2024} from UCI Machine Learning Repository \\citep{markelle_kelly_uci_nodate}. These datasets—Australian Credit Approval (AUS) \\citep{quinlan_statlog_1987} , German Credit Data (GER) \\citep{hofmann_statlog_1994}, Default of Credit Card Clients (DEF) \\citep{yeh_default_2009}, and South German Credit (SGER) \\citep{noauthor_south_2019}—are all publicly available from open-access sources and have been widely used in prior research on credit risk prediction. They span a range of scales in terms of sample size, attribute count, and class imbalance, and collectively represent diverse real-world scenarios of credit application approval, default behavior, and credit scoring. To shape these datasets in the so-referred tabular structure for input into our graph-based modeling pipeline, standard preprocessing steps are applied. Missing values, if present, are treated through imputation or removal. Continuous and ordinal variables are normalized to the $[0,1]$ range using min–max scaling to ensure numerical comparability across features. While ordinal variables are discrete, they are commonly treated as continuous during scaling to retain their rank information without inflating dimensionality. Categorical (nominal) variables are transformed into binary dummy variables to preserve their semantic meaning and ensure compatibility with distance-based similarity metrics. The original study states that: “The four experimental datasets in our study are numeric...” \\citep{shi_improved_2024}, but provides no further details on how nominal variables were handled. This ambiguity in feature type treatment may partially explain the differences observed in baseline model performance during our replication. In contrast, we explicitly identify and process nominal variables by generating dummy variables, while treating ordinal variables as continuous for the purpose of scaling. Table~\\ref{tab:data_summary} summarizes the dimensional changes resulting from our preprocessing, along with the class distributions in each dataset. Modeling: The remaining notebooks.

    "description": "Data and Code to reproduce results in paper \"Explaining Regime Dynamics: A Tree-based Interpretation Framework for R2-RD Models\" This is a working paper. The restriction on codes will be removed after publication. This repository contains the necessary codes to reproduce results in the paper. Raw data: README.txt This study focuses on exploring the dynamics of macro-financial regimes with relevance to credit markets. As such, we require a rich set of time series reflecting credit activity and lending behavior over time. The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis provides comprehensive, publicly accessible data on the U.S. credit market, and is thus selected as our primary data source. The FRED restrics access to redistribute the data (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/legal/). Thus, it is not allowed to upload the raw data. However, the README.txt file is uploaded. This is the metadata for the collected data. It presents the \"Series ID\", \"Start Period\", \"End Period\" of the collected series. With this metadata, researcher should be able to collect the same dataset from the platform (https://fred.stlouisfed.org). Data cleaning: app.py This file contains the code to clean the dataset, as described in the paper Section 3.2. To ensure temporal consistency, we restrict all time series to the period from January 2000 to the data download date (September 25, 2025). This window provides sufficient coverage while avoiding earlier periods with sparse observations. We first assess missing values across the selected series. Figure~\\ref{fig:missing-data} visualizes the missing data pattern, where dark blue indicates available values and light blue indicates missing entries. If a series had more than 60\\% missing values within the selected period, it was discarded. After this filtering step, 60 time series remained. For the retained series, missing values were imputed using time-based linear interpolation, which estimates missing values by linearly interpolating between the nearest available observations before and after the missing entry, based on their time indices. This method preserves the temporal continuity of each series and provides a reasonable approximation for short gaps. Upon visual inspection, some series still exhibited strong upward or downward trends, which violates the stationarity assumption required by the R2-RD model. Therefore, we applied first-order differencing to each series, defined as $\\Delta x_t = x_t - x_{t-1}$. After differencing, the majority of series no longer display clear trending behavior, suggesting that the transformation has effectively removed most of the non-stationary components and prepared the data for regime-based modeling. After these steps, we obtained a clean dataset of 60 monthly series, with missing values handled and long-term trends removed, ready for modeling. Notably, we did not apply any standard normalization (e.g., z-score or min-max scaling) at this stage. This decision is motivated by three considerations: (1) normalization typically requires computing global statistics such as the full-sample mean or range, which would violate the expanding-window assumption underpinning the robust rolling regime detection framework; (2) in the next step, we apply R2-PCA, a dimensionality reduction technique that includes built-in normalization consistent with an expanding-window structure; and (3) while Hidden Markov Models are not inherently scale-invariant, the R2-RD framework operates on the principal component space where the scale sensitivity has already been addressed through R2-PCA preprocessing.

Through combining traditional credit features with network topological features, namely the degree centrality, we showcase the crucial role of a borrower’s position and connectivity within the P2P network in determining loan default probabilities. Our findings are bolstered by robustness checks using shuffled centrality features, which further underscore the significance of integrating both financial and network attributes in credit risk evaluation. Our results shed new light on credit risk determinants in P2P lending and benefit investors in capturing inherent information from P2P loan networks.Keywords: Peer-to-Peer lending; Credit-default prediction; Machine Learning; Network centrality Raw data: The raw dataset was downloaded on April 22nd, 2022, as a part of Bandora’s daily updated public report.3 Loan starting dates span from June 16th, 2009, to April 21st, 2022.
