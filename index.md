## Research Project

### Background

Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has become an increasingly popular alternative to traditional bank lending, allowing individuals and businesses to borrow money directly from investors through online platforms without involving banks. While this method offers advantages such as higher returns for investors and greater access to credit for borrowers, it also brings unique risks. The decentralized nature of P2P lending means that loans are funded entirely by investors, without the safeguards of bank intermediation.

### Rationale

The growing presence of P2P lending markets, especially during economic crises, exposes these platforms to significant risks, including adverse selection and moral hazard. Unlike traditional banks that use long-term relationships and extensive data to evaluate borrowers, P2P platforms have less detailed information and face higher levels of uncertainty. There is a critical need for robust credit risk models that can accurately assess the creditworthiness of borrowers in these markets.

### Objectives

This project aims to develop **advanced, interpretable credit risk models** tailored specifically to the needs of P2P lending markets. These models will address the unique challenges of P2P lending, such as:

- Higher information asymmetry
- Less regulation compared to traditional banking
- Increased risk during economic downturns

The ultimate goal is to enhance trust between investors and P2P platforms by providing accurate tools for evaluating and mitigating credit risk.

### Methods

The project develops credit risk models using **network-based approaches**, analyzing the connections between borrowers and lenders to identify patterns that indicate heightened risk. These models incorporate:

- **Static factors**: Established risk indicators
- **Dynamic factors**: Real-time data for adaptive risk assessment
- **Network topology**: Graph-based features capturing borrower-lender relationships

### Expected Impact

By providing more reliable credit risk models, this project will strengthen the P2P lending market, making it a more secure and viable alternative to traditional bank lending. The results will be valuable to:

- P2P platforms and investors
- Policymakers and regulators
- Financial institutions
- Academic researchers

  <h3>1. Network centrality and credit risk: A comprehensive analysis of peer-to-peer lending dynamics</h3>
  <p class="citation">Liu, Y., Baals, L. J., Osterrieder, J., & Hadji-Misheva, B. (2024). <em>Finance Research Letters</em>, 63, 105308.</p>
  <p class="abstract">This letter analyzes credit risk assessment in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending domain by leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Bondora, a leading European P2P platform. Through combining traditional credit features with network topological features, namely the degree centrality, we showcase the crucial role of a borrower's position and connectivity within the P2P network in determining loan default probabilities. Our findings are bolstered by robustness checks using shuffled centrality features, which further underscore the significance of integrating both financial and network attributes in credit risk evaluation.</p>

  <h3>2. Leveraging network topology for credit risk assessment in P2P lending: A comparative study under the lens of machine learning</h3>

  <p class="abstract">This study proposes an enhanced two-step modeling approach for Machine Learning (ML) that utilizes insights from network analysis and subsequently combines derived network centrality metrics with traditional credit risk factors to improve the prediction accuracy in the credit default prediction process. Through a comparative analysis of three classical ML models (Elastic Net, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron), we showcase novel evidence that the systematic inclusion of network topology features in the credit scoring process can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the scoring models.</p>
